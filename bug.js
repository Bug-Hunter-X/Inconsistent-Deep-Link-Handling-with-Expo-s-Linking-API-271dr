This bug occurs when using Expo's `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The `Linking.addEventListener` method might not fire consistently or might miss certain deep link events, particularly when the app is in the background or is launched from a cold start.  This can lead to unexpected behavior where the app doesn't react to deep links as intended.  The problem is exacerbated in Android, but it can also be seen in iOS under certain circumstances. The following example illustrates a scenario where the listener is registered, but it never triggers:

```javascript
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';

Linking.addEventListener('url', (url) => {
  console.log('Deep link received:', url);
  // Handle the deep link here
});

Linking.getInitialURL().then(url => {
  if (url) {
    console.log('Initial URL:', url);
    // Handle initial URL
  }
});
```
